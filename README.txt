# 3D-Object Maker

3D-Object Maker is an application developed in C++ utilizing GLFW, GLAD, ASSIMP, GLM, and STB_IMAGE libraries. It renders 3D objects and applies lighting effects by implementing 3D graphic techniques from scratch.

## Features

- Render 3D objects
- Apply lighting effects
- Manipulate 3D graphics techniques

2. Make sure you have C++ compiler installed.
3. Install necessary libraries: GLFW, GLAD, ASSIMP, GLM, and STB_IMAGE.
4. Build the application using your preferred build system (e.g., CMake).
5. Run the executable.
### Note
Because of the purpose the reduction of file's size, after the build with release or debug mode, copy file "resource" in the project file "3D Engine-Core" to the Debug or Release file in order to operate correctly
